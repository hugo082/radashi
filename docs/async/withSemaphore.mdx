### Usage

Creates a [semaphore-protected](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)>) async function that limits concurrent execution to a specified number of active uses.
Additional calls will wait for previous executions to complete.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const exclusiveFn = _.withSemaphore(2, async () => {
  // Do stuff
})

exclusiveFn() // run immediatly
exclusiveFn() // run immediatly
exclusiveFn() // wait until semaphore is released
```

#### Using with task based functions

Execution function can be passed as a task parameter and ignored at the semaphore creation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const exclusiveFn = _.withSemaphore({ capacity: 2 })

exclusiveFn(async permit => {
  // Do stuff
})
```

#### Weighted tasks

Each task can require a specific weight from a semaphore. In this example two tasks each weighted with 2 from
a semaphore with a capacity of 2. As a result they are mutually exclusive.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const exclusiveFn = _.withSemaphore({ capacity: 2 })

exclusiveFn({ weight: 2 }, async permit => {}) // run immediatly
exclusiveFn({ weight: 2 }, async permit => {}) // wait until semaphore is released
```

### Manual lock management

The semaphore can be manually acquired and released for fine-grained control over locking behavior.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const semaphore = _.withSemaphore({ capacity: 2 })

const permit = await semaphore.acquire()

// Do stuff

permit.release()
```
