### Usage

Creates a mutex-protected async function that limits concurrent execution to a single use at a time. Additional calls will wait for the mutex to be released before executing.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const exclusiveFn = _.withMutex(async () => {
  // Do stuff
})

exclusiveFn() // run immediatly
exclusiveFn() // wait until mutex is released
```

#### Using with task based functions

Execution function can be passed as a task parameter and ignored at the mutex creation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const exclusiveFn = _.withMutex()

exclusiveFn(async permit => {
  // Do stuff
})
```

### Manual lock management

The mutex can be manually acquired and released for fine-grained control over locking behavior.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const mutex = _.withMutex()

const permit = await mutex.acquire()
mutex.isLocked() // true

// Do stuff

permit.release()
mutex.isLocked() // false
```
